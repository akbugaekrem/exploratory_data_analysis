Exploratory Data Analysis
Now we will apply EDA to a real-world dataset which is useful for data science projects. We will accomplish it in by completing each task in the project:

Defining Exploratory Data Analysis with an overview of the whole project
Importing libraries and Exploring the Dataset
Checking missing values and Outliers
Creating visual methods to analyze the data
Analyzing trends, patterns, and relationships in the Data
